        <p>COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a viral infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and
          is currently a World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic. As of July 31 2020, 17 million
          people had been infected globally with over 685,000 deaths. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue,
          shortness of breath,
          and loss of smell and taste. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute
          respiratory distress
          syndrome (ARDS). The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range
          from two to fourteen days.
          The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, most often via small droplets produced by
          coughing, sneezing, and talking. For more information click on the <a href="/faq">FAQs link</a> or visit
